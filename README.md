## About this project
### **How the app works**
This project uses React to create an Employee Directory. The application's UI is broken up into components, manages component state and responds to user events. 
  
### **Business Context** 
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
<br>

### **Tools**
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The editor of choice
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) to share the code
* [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to randomly generate "employees" for this task

* **Technology:**
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Axios npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
  * [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
